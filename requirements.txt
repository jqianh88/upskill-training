Objective:
Create an Angular application that fetches data from a mock HTTP service, displays it in a list, and allows users to interact with the list items using forms and animations.

Requirements:
Implement a service called DataService that provides methods for fetching and managing mock data. This service should use Angular's HttpClient module to simulate HTTP requests.

Create a component called ListComponent that displays the list of items fetched from the DataService. Each list item should contain a form with editable fields and an animation effect when hovered over.

Implement reactive forms in the ListComponent to allow users to edit the fields of each list item. Use Angular's ReactiveFormsModule for form management.

Utilize Angular animations to provide a smooth animation effect when hovering over each list item. The animation should scale the item slightly when hovered over.

Ensure that changes made to the form fields are reflected in real-time and saved back to the mock data through the DataService.

interface Item {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  description: string;
}

const MOCK_DATA: Item[] = [
  { id: 1, name: "Item 1", description: "Description for Item 1" },
  { id: 2, name: "Item 2", description: "Description for Item 2" },
  { id: 3, name: "Item 3", description: "Description for Item 3" },
  { id: 4, name: "Item 4", description: "Description for Item 4" },
  { id: 5, name: "Item 5", description: "Description for Item 5" }
];


Steps to Complete the Exercise:
Set up a new Angular project using the Angular CLI (ng new my-app).
Generate the DataService service and implement methods for fetching and managing mock data.
Create the ListComponent component and implement the HTML template to display the list of items with editable forms and animation.
Implement reactive forms in the ListComponent to enable editing of list item fields.
Add Angular animations to provide the hover effect on list items.
Ensure that changes made to the form fields are reflected in real-time and saved back to the mock data through the DataService.
Test the application to ensure that it meets the requirements and functions correctly.
Notes:
Remember to import HttpClientModule in the AppModule to use Angular's HttpClient module.
Use Angular CLI commands (ng generate service, ng generate component) to create new services and components.
Refer to the official Angular documentation and tutorials for guidance on implementing reactive forms and animations if needed.
Use Angular Material for styling and UI components if desired to enhance the visual appearance of the application.
